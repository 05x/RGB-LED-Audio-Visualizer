# RGB-LED-Audio-Visualizer

A lot of this code was written last year, when the extent of my C/C++ knowledge came from an intro to programming course and the Arduino starter kit. I've recently reorganized and cleaned everything up for readabilty, and I'm in the process of adding more comments. A few functions need revisions for efficiency & clarity, I'll be addressing that soon.

Coming soon: an iOS companion app that interfaces with the device via Bluetooth.
