# RGB-LED-Audio-Visualizer

A lot of this code was written last year, when the extent of my C/C++ knowledge came from an intro to programming course and the Arduino starter kit. As it was written piece-by-piece as a learning project (wih little-to-no planning), the current master.ino file is VERY messy. But it works. It needs some revisions for efficiency & clarity, which I'm working on fixing in the develop branch right now.
