# RGB-LED-Audio-Visualizer

A lot of this code was written last year, when the extent of my C/C++ knowledge came from an intro to programming course and the Arduino starter kit. It could use some revisions for efficiency & clarity, but I'm going to leave it the way it I first wrote it because it works, and it serves to show me how far I've come since then.
